# 'checker' should map problemID to a program name that is to be used to check out.
# You can code checker as per your need. They are simple C/CPP programs that take as argument two filenames locally available.
# The first file is, JUDGE output and second is contestant solution. If your problem has no JUDGE output, use a empty file and dont use it latter on.
# The program as its exit code ( return '0' / return '1' ) should return verdict as correct (0) or wrong (!0).
#
# By default, we provide a simple checker, exact.out that checks character by character.
